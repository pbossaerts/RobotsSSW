Programs and data for "Humans in charge of trading robots"

MelboR* are folders with data and programs for the first set of 4 experiments where participants were free to deploy chosen robots and could stop them at any time.
There are two main python programs that read the two main types of file:
- Files: Marketplace order/trading data (output15*.xls) and robot logs (r*robot.xls)
- Programs: PAspread_E*.py: python program that outputs b/a spreads and trading data; Probot_E*.py: python program that outputs robot use data (after merging trading data with robot logs)
- Please see notes files in some of the directories for rare (2) impurities in the data and how we addressed them
Output csv files: title should make clear what the content is; if not, see python programs.
